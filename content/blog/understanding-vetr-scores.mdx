# What Is a VETR Score?

Every stock on VETTR receives a **VETR Score** — a single number between 0 and 100 that represents the overall health and investability of a mining or resource company. Think of it as a report card for the stock: the higher the score, the stronger the company looks across the metrics that matter most to diligent investors.

The VETR Score is not a price prediction. It is a diagnostic tool that tells you whether a company's fundamentals, management quality, and filing history deserve your attention — or your caution.

## How Scores Are Calculated

The VETR Score is built from four weighted pillars, each analysing a different dimension of the company:

- **Financial Health (30%)** — Examines cash position, burn rate, debt-to-equity ratio, revenue trends, and working capital. Companies with strong treasuries and low debt score higher.
- **Management Quality (25%)** — Evaluates the executive team and board of directors based on their track records, past successes and failures, and involvement across multiple public companies.
- **Filing Analysis (25%)** — Uses AI to parse recent financial statements, MD&A disclosures, and technical reports. Consistent, transparent filings boost the score; late or vague disclosures lower it.
- **Red Flag Count (20%)** — Every active red flag — insider selling, dilution events, related-party transactions, cease trade orders — pulls the score down proportionally.

Each pillar generates a sub-score, and the weighted combination produces the final VETR Score.

## What the Ranges Mean

| Score Range | Label | Color | What It Means |
|---|---|---|---|
| **80 – 100** | Strong Buy | Green | Fundamentals are solid, management has a strong track record, and few or no red flags are present. This company passes the vetting process with flying colours. |
| **60 – 79** | Buy | Yellow | A generally healthy company with some areas to watch. Review the flagged items before committing capital. |
| **40 – 59** | Hold | Orange | Meaningful concerns exist. The company may have elevated debt, a mixed management history, or several active red flags. Proceed with extra caution. |
| **0 – 39** | Caution | Red | Significant risk factors are present. Multiple red flags, poor financials, or questionable management warrant serious scrutiny before investing. |

## How Often Do Scores Update?

VETR Scores are recalculated whenever new data arrives — a fresh filing, an insider transaction report, or an updated financial statement. In practice, most scores update at least weekly, and you will receive an alert any time a stock you follow experiences a meaningful score change.

## Using VETR Scores Effectively

The VETR Score is designed to be a starting point, not the final word. Use it to quickly screen a watchlist, identify which companies deserve deeper research, and spot deterioration in stocks you already own. Combined with VETTR's Red Flag details and Executive Pedigree profiles, the score gives you a comprehensive due diligence framework — all from a single app.
