# Why We Built VETTR

Retail investors in the mining and resource sector face a unique challenge. Unlike blue-chip stocks with abundant analyst coverage, mining companies often fly under the radar with limited research available. Sifting through SEDAR filings, press releases, and financial statements to evaluate a junior miner takes hours of painstaking work — and even then, critical red flags can slip through.

VETTR was built to change that. We created an AI-powered platform that automates the due diligence process, giving everyday investors the same quality of analysis that institutional investors rely on. Whether you are evaluating a gold explorer, a lithium developer, or a base metals producer, VETTR helps you make informed decisions backed by data, not hype.

## What VETTR Offers

At the heart of VETTR is the **VETR Score** — a proprietary rating from 0 to 100 that distills a company's overall health into a single, easy-to-understand number. But that is just the beginning. VETTR also provides:

- **Red Flag Detection** — Automatically surfaces warning signs like insider selling, excessive dilution, related-party transactions, and late filings.
- **Executive Pedigree Tracking** — Evaluates management teams based on their track record, board relationships, and history across multiple companies.
- **Real-Time Alerts** — Get notified when a stock you follow triggers a new red flag, releases a filing, or sees a significant score change.
- **Filing Analysis** — AI-powered summaries of financial statements, MD&A sections, and technical reports so you can get the key takeaways in seconds.
