# Why Mining Stocks Need Extra Scrutiny

Mining and resource companies operate in one of the most capital-intensive, regulation-heavy industries in the market. A promising drill result can send a stock soaring, but a failed feasibility study or a dilutive financing round can wipe out gains overnight. For retail investors, the challenge is separating genuine opportunity from promotional noise — and that requires a structured due diligence process.

Here are the key areas every investor should examine before buying a mining stock, and how VETTR helps automate much of that work.

## 1. Management Pedigree

The people running a mining company matter more than in almost any other sector. A proven management team with a history of advancing projects, closing financings, and delivering shareholder value is one of the strongest indicators of future success.

**What to check:** Look at the CEO, CFO, and key board members. Have they built and sold mines before? Do they have technical backgrounds or are they primarily promoters? Are they associated with companies that failed or faced regulatory action?

**How VETTR helps:** The Executive Pedigree feature profiles every director and officer, tracking their involvement across all public companies and flagging any concerning history.

## 2. Financial Health

A mining company's balance sheet tells you how long it can survive and whether it needs to raise capital — which often means dilution for existing shareholders.

**What to check:** Cash on hand, monthly burn rate, outstanding debt, and whether the company can fund its next milestone without a financing. Review the most recent financial statements and MD&A for any going-concern warnings.

**How VETTR helps:** The Financial Health pillar of the VETR Score crunches these numbers automatically and flags companies at risk of running out of cash.

## 3. Dilution History

Share dilution is the silent killer of mining stock returns. Many junior miners finance their operations through repeated private placements, warrants, and options that steadily erode the value of existing shares.

**What to check:** Compare the current share count to what it was one, two, and five years ago. Look at the number of outstanding warrants and options relative to the float. A company that doubles its share count every two years is a red flag.

**How VETTR helps:** Dilution events are tracked as red flags in VETTR. The app shows you the percentage increase in shares outstanding over time.

## 4. Insider Trading Activity

Insider buying is often a bullish signal — management is putting their own money on the line. Insider selling, especially heavy or unusual patterns, can indicate that those closest to the company see trouble ahead.

**What to check:** Review SEDI filings (in Canada) or SEC Form 4 filings (in the US) for recent insider transactions. Pay attention to the size and timing of trades relative to news releases.

**How VETTR helps:** Insider transactions are monitored automatically and flagged when selling patterns exceed normal thresholds.

## 5. Project Stage and Jurisdiction

A grassroots exploration project carries vastly different risk than a permitted, construction-ready mine. Similarly, a project in a mining-friendly jurisdiction like Nevada or Ontario is generally lower risk than one in a region with political instability or uncertain permitting.

**What to check:** Understand what stage the project is at — early exploration, resource estimate, PEA, feasibility, permitted, or in production. Research the jurisdiction for regulatory risk, tax regimes, and local community relations.

## 6. Putting It All Together

Due diligence is not a one-time exercise. Mining companies evolve — they acquire projects, lose key personnel, raise capital, and hit or miss exploration targets. Staying on top of these changes is what separates informed investors from speculators.

VETTR was designed to make continuous due diligence practical. Set up your watchlist, monitor your VETR Scores, review red flags as they appear, and dive into executive profiles when management changes occur. The information that used to take hours to compile is now available at a glance — so you can focus on making better investment decisions.
